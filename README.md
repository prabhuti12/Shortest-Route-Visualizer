# Shortest-Route-Visualizer
Developed a Shortest Route Visualizer that gives the visual representation of the shortest path from source to destination. Implemented Dijkstra Algorithm, which gives the shortest path on an weighted graph as well as Breadth First Search Algorithm (BFS) which gives the shortest path on an unweighted graph from source to destination.
